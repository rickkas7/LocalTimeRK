# LocalTimeRK

*Timezone and DST handling for Particle devices*

This library is designed for specific local time and daylight saving time scenarios on Particle devices. It is not intended to solve all problems in all situations, however it will work well in certain scenarios:

- [Full API docs](https://rickkas7.github.io/LocalTimeRK/)
- Github repository: [https://github.com/rickkas7/LocalTimeRK/](https://github.com/rickkas7/LocalTimeRK/)
- License: MIT

**What it's good for:**

- Managing local time, and daylight saving time, if needed, on devices in a known location
- Mostly intended for devices in your own home
- Managing scheduling of tasks at a specific local time
- Displaying local time

**What it's not intended for:**

- Mobile devices that may change locations
- Customer devices that could be in any timezone

## Features

- Timezone configuration using a POSIX timezone rule string
- Does not require network access to determine timezone and daylight saving transitions
- Good for displaying local time, such as on clock-like devices
- Good for scheduling operations at a specific local time. For example, every day at 8:00 AM regardless of timezone and DST
- Support for locations with DST and without DST (timezone only)
- Should work in the southern hemisphere were DST is opposite on the calendar
- Should work in any country as long as a compatible POSIX timezone configuration string can be generated

## What is a POSIX timezone configuration?

For the United States east coast, the configuration string is:

```
EST5EDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00"
```

What this means is:

- "EST" is the standard time timezone name
- 5 is the offset from UTC in hours. Actually -5, as the sign is backwards from the way it's normally expressed. And it could be hours and minutes.
- "EDT" is the daylight saving time timezone name
- "M3.2.0" is when DST starts. Month 3 (March), 2nd week, 0 = Sunday
- "2:00:00" transition to DST at 2:00 AM local time
- "M11.1.0" transition back to standard time November, 1st week, on Sunday
- "2:00:00" transition back to standard time at 2:00 AM local time

There are a bunch of supported formats, including for locations that don't have DST (such as Arizona, "MST7") and southern hemisphere where daylight saving is on the opposite part of the year, such as Eastern Australian time used in Sydney, Australia "AEST-10AEDT,M10.1.0/02:00:00,M4.1.0/03:00:00".

## Using for scheduling

This library does not modify the `Time` class timezone! This has the potential to disrupt all sorts of things that depend on `Time`, and should be avoided. A new class and methods provide access to local time when needed.

Additionally, it's designed to handle scheduling. For example, say you want to perform an operation at 3:00 AM every day, local time. The class can find the UTC time corresponding to this, taking into account timezones and DST changes. Using `Time.now()` comparisons (at UTC) is fast and efficient. It's also good when you want to store the desired time in EEPROM, retained memory, or the file system.

The library also handles weird transition scenarios that occur on spring forward (in the north hemisphere) where the hour from 2:00 AM local time to 2:59:59 doesn't exist, and in the fall back where the hour from 1:00:00 to 1:59:59 local time occurs twice.

It also handles other common scheduling scenarios:

- Tomorrow (same time)
- Tomorrow (at a specific local time)
- On a specific day of week at a specific time ("every Saturday at 3:00 AM")
- On a day of week with an ordinal ("on the 2nd Saturday of the month")
- On a specific day of month at a specific time
- Also the last day of the month, the second to last day of the month, ...
- On the next weekday (Monday - Friday)
- On the next weekend day (Saturday - Sunday)

## Clock Example

There is an example of using the library to use an Adafruit FeatherWing OLED Display 128x32 as a clock.

The display is available at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2900). You can find more technical information [at Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-oled-featherwing/overview). The library is available in the Web IDE as [oled-wing-adafruit](https://build.particle.io/libs/oled-wing-adafruit/0.0.4/tab/oled-wing-adafruit.cpp). You can find additional documentation [here](https://github.com/rickkas7/oled-wing-adafruit).

The code example is in the more-examples directory in the Clock directory and is quite simple:

```cpp
#include "Particle.h"

#include "LocalTimeRK.h"
#include "oled-wing-adafruit.h"

SerialLogHandler logHandler;

SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);

OledWingAdafruit display;

void setup() {
    // Set timezone to the Eastern United States
    LocalTime::instance().withConfig(LocalTimePosixTimezone("EST5EDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00"));

	display.setup();

	display.clearDisplay();
	display.display();
}

void loop() {
    static unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;
    if (millis() - lastUpdate >= 1000 && Time.isValid()) {
        lastUpdate = millis();

        LocalTimeConvert conv;
        conv.withCurrentTime().convert();

        // Log.info("local time: %s", conv.format(TIME_FORMAT_ISO8601_FULL).c_str());
        
        // Room for 11 characters at text size 2
        display.clearDisplay();
        display.setTextColor(WHITE);
        display.setTextSize(2);
        display.setFont(NULL);
        display.setCursor(0, 1);

        String msg;

        msg = conv.format("%Y-%m-%d"); // 2021-06-07
        display.println(msg);

        msg = conv.format("%I:%M:%S%p"); // 10:00:00AM
        display.println(msg);

        display.display();
    }
}
```

## Using the library


### Configure the timezone

- Determine the POSIX timezone string for your location. For example, the US eastern timezone is shown in the example

- At setup, configure the timezone:

```cpp
LocalTime::instance().withConfig(LocalTimePosixTimezone("EST5EDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00"));
```

Some configuration strings:

| Location | Timezone Configuration |
| :--- | :--- |
| New York | "EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00:00,M11.1.0/02:00:00" |
| Chicago | "CST6CDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00" |
| Denver | "MST7MDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00" |
| Phoenix | "MST7" |
| Los Angeles | "PST8PDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00" |
| London | "BST0GMT,M3.5.0/1:00:00,M10.5.0/2:00:00" |
| Sydney, Australia | "AEST-10AEDT,M10.1.0/02:00:00,M4.1.0/03:00:00" | 
| Adelaide, Australia | "ACST-9:30ACDT,M10.1.0/02:00:00,M4.1.0/03:00:00" |
| UTC | "UTC" |

### Getting the current local time

Use the `LocalTimeConvert` class like this to get the current time:

```cpp
LocalTimeConvert conv;
conv.withCurrentTime().convert();
```

This will initialize the `conv` object with information about the current local time in the timezone you have configured.

Additional useful LocalTimeConvert methods:

<details>

#### bool LocalTimeConvert::isDST() const 

Returns true if the current time is in daylight saving time.

```
bool isDST() const
```

---

#### bool LocalTimeConvert::isStandardTime() const 

Returns true of the current time in in standard time.

```
bool isStandardTime() const
```


---

#### String LocalTimeConvert::timeStr() 

Works like Time.timeStr() to generate a readable string of the local time.

```
String timeStr()
```

Uses asctime formatting, which looks like "Fri Jan  1 18:45:56 2021". The strings are not localized; they're always in English.

---

#### String LocalTimeConvert::format(const char * formatSpec) 

Works like Time.format()

```
String format(const char * formatSpec)
```

##### Parameters
* `formatSpec` the format specifies, which can be

* TIME_FORMAT_DEFAULT (example: "Thu Apr  1 12:00:00 2021")

* TIME_FORMAT_ISO8601_FULL (example: "2021-04-01T12:00:00-04:00")

* custom format based on strftime()

There are many options to strftime described here: [https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/?kw=strftime](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/?kw=strftime)

Unlike Time.format(), you can use Z to output the timezone abbreviation, for example "EDT" for the Eastern United States, daylight saving instead of -04:00.

The z formatting matches that of Time.format(), which is wrong. The correct output should be "-400" but the output will be "-04:00" for compatibility.

If you want to make a US-style AM/PM clock display, the formatting string "%I:%M %p" will produce something like "12:30 PM".

---

#### String LocalTimeConvert::zoneName() const 

Returns the abbreviated time zone name for the current time.

```
String zoneName() const
```

For example, for the United States east coast, EST or EDT depending on whether the current time is DST or not. See also isDST().

This string comes from the LocalTimePosixTimezone object.


### Converting UTC to local time

Use the `LocalTimeConvert` class like this to get the current time:

```cpp
time_t timeVal = 1612393852; // Wednesday, February 3, 2021 11:10:52 PM

LocalTimeConvert conv;
conv.withTime(timeVal).convert();
```

</details>


## Advanced scheduling

An advanced scheduling mode was added in version 0.0.8. This allows complex schedules such as:

- Every 15 minutes in the hour, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time, Monday - Friday, except on 2022-03-21
- Every 4 hours of the day starting at 00:00:00 (midnight) other times

This can either be specified in code, or it can be expressed in JSON. JSON allows the schedule to be updating using a Particle.function, for example. 

This is a compact representation of that schedule in 77 bytes of JSON data:

```
[{"mh":15,"y":62,"s":"09:00:00","e":"16:59:59","x":["2022-03-21"]},{"hd":4}]
```

While scheduling is designed to work with local time, each schedule calculator can optionally have a time zone override, which makes it possible to do some calculations at UTC if you prefer to do that.

### Using a schedule

This is the code in examples/2-schedule:

```cpp
#include "LocalTimeRK.h"

SerialLogHandler logHandler;
SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);

LocalTimeSchedule publishSchedule;

void setup() {
    // Set timezone to the Eastern United States
    LocalTime::instance().withConfig(LocalTimePosixTimezone("EST5EDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00"));

    // Publish every 5 minutes at :00, :05, :10, ...
    publishSchedule.withMinuteOfHour(5);
}

void loop() {
    if (publishSchedule.isScheduledTime() && Particle.connected()) {
        Particle.publish("testEvent", "scheduled publish!");
    }
}
```

This is a simple example that publishes at :00, :05, :10, .... Note that these are clock times, not rolling times.

Technically you don't need a timezone for this example since it doesn't do any hour-based calculations, but it's set using `withConfig()` when you need to use one.

The part in loop() tests to see if it's time to publish and then publishes. As shown in the example, if you are not connected to the cloud at the scheduled time, that scheduled time is skipped.

If you reverse the order in the if statement, then if you are not connected to the cloud, it's possible to get publish immediately after reconnecting to the cloud to make up for the one that was missed.

```cpp
    // Allow one out-of-schedule publish to catch up for a missed publish in this order
    if (Particle.connected() && publishSchedule.isScheduledTime())
```

The real benefit is when you start to make more complex schedules, such as:

```cpp
// Every 15 minutes between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time Monday - Friday
publishSchedule.withMinuteOfHour(15, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("09:00:00"), LocalTimeHMS("16:59:59"), LocalTimeRestrictedDate(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::MASK_WEEKDAY)));

// Every hour otherwise
publishSchedule.withMinuteOfHour(60);
```

You can exclude dates from a schedule. For example, the every 15 minutes on weekdays schedule excludes Monday, April 11, 2022 with this schedule:

```cpp
publishSchedule.withMinuteOfHour(15, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("09:00:00"), LocalTimeHMS("16:59:59"), 
    LocalTimeRestrictedDate(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::MASK_WEEKDAY, {}, {"2022-04-11"})));
publishSchedule.withMinuteOfHour(60);
```

### LocalTimeSchedule items

LocalTimeSchedule include things like every n minutes, every n hours, as well as day of week and day of month multiples. Each multiple has a type, an increment, in some cases additional data, and a `LocalTimeRange` that determines when the multiple is used.

`LocalTimeRange` is itself composed of a `TimeRange`, and a `LocalTimeRestrictedDate`. This specifies both the time of day, as well as an optional restriction on the dates it applies. See above for for an explanation of these types.

#### Minute of hour

This schedule item is used for "every n minutes." For example, if you want to publish an event every 15 minutes.

```cpp
// PROTOTYPE (class LocalTimeSchedule)
LocalTimeSchedule &withMinuteOfHour(int increment, LocalTimeRange timeRange = LocalTimeRange());
```

- Minute multiples are relative to the hour, so you typically want to use an increment that 60 is evenly divisible by in order to keep the period constant (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30).
- The `LocalTimeRange` can restrict this to certain hours of the day, and certain days of the week. It can also handle exception dates, both only on date, or to exclude dates.
- The minute of the start of the time range specifies the offset relative to the hour to start the increment from (modulo the increment).
- The second of the start of the time range specifies the second offset.

For example, every 15 minutes all day, at 05:00, 20:00, 35:00, 50:00:

```cpp
schedule.withMinuteOfHour(15, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("00:05:00")));
```

Every 5 minutes from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time every day:

```cpp
schedule.withMinuteOfHour(5, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("09:00:00"), LocalTimeHMS("16:59:59")))
```

Every 5 minutes from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time on weekdays (not Saturday or Sunday):

```cpp
schedule.withMinuteOfHour(5, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("09:00:00"), LocalTimeHMS("16:59:59"), LocalTimeRestrictedDate(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::MASK_WEEKDAY)));
```

In generating from JSON:

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "mh" | integer | Minute of hour multiple | |
| "f" | integer | Flag bits (optional) | 0 |
| "s" | string | The start time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "00:00:00" |
| "e" | string | The end time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "23:59:59" |
| "y" | integer | Mask value for days of the week (optional) |
| "a" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to allow specific dates (optional) |
| "x" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to exclude specific dates (optional) |


#### Hour of day multiples

This schedule is used for "every n hours." For example, if you want to wake and publish every 4 hours.

```cpp
// PROTOTYPE (class LocalTimeSchedule)
LocalTimeSchedule &withHourOfDay(int hourMultiple, LocalTimeRange timeRange = LocalTimeRange());
```

- Hour multiples are relative to the day, so you typically want to use a value that 24 is evenly divisible by (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12).
- The `LocalTimeRange` can restrict this to certain hours of the day, and certain days of the week. It can also handle exception dates, both only on date, or to exclude dates.
- The hour of the start of the time range specifies the offset relative to the day to start the increment from (modulo the increment)
- The minute and second of the start of the time range specifies the minute and second offset

For example, every 2 hours (00:00, 02:00, 04:00) local time.

```cpp
schedule.withHourOfDay(2);
```

Every 2 hours, but starting at 01:30 local time (01:30, 03:30, 05:03, ...).

```cpp
schedule.withHourOfDay(2, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("01:30:00"), LocalTimeHMS("23:59:59")));
```

Every 15 minutes between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time, otherwise every 2 hours (00:00, 02:00, 04:00 local time)

```cpp
schedule.withMinuteOfHour(15, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("09:00:00"), LocalTimeHMS("16:59:59")));
schedule.withHourOfDay(2);
```

If configuring by JSON:

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "hd" | integer | Hour of day multiple | |
| "f" | integer | Flag bits (optional) | 0 |
| "s" | string | The start time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "00:00:00" |
| "e" | string | The end time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "23:59:59" |
| "y" | integer | Mask value for days of the week (optional) |
| "a" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to allow specific dates (optional) |
| "x" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to exclude specific dates (optional) |


#### Day of week of the month 

This is used for things like: "Every first Monday of the month," "Every second Tuesday of the month," or "Last Friday of the month."

```cpp
// PROTOTYPE (class LocalTimeSchedule)
LocalTimeSchedule &withDayOfWeekOfMonth(int dayOfWeek, int instance, LocalTimeRange timeRange = LocalTimeRange());
```

- The dayOfWeek specifies the day of the week (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, ..., Saturday = 6).
- The instance specifies which instance (1 = first, 2 = second, ... Or -1 = last, -2 = second to last, ...)
- The `LocalTimeRange` can restrict this to certain hours of the day, and certain days of the week. It can also handle exception dates, both only on date, or to exclude dates.
- The start of the time range specifies the hour, minute, and second (local time)
- Use a time of day with day of week restriction instead if you want to do "Every Monday"

First Saturday of the month at midnight local time:

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfWeekOfMonth(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::DAY_SATURDAY, 1);
```

First Monday of the month at 9:00 AM local time:

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfWeekOfMonth(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::DAY_MONDAY, 1, LocalTimeHMS("09:00:00"));
```

Last Friday of the month at 5 PM local time.

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfWeekOfMonth(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::DAY_FRIDAY, -1, LocalTimeHMS("17:00:00"));
```


| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "dw" | integer | Day of week instance (1 = first, 2 = second, ..., or -1 = last, -2 = second to last, ... | |
| "d" | integer | Day of the week 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ..., 6 = Saturday |
| "f" | integer | Flag bits (optional) | 0 |
| "s" | string | The start time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "00:00:00" |
| "e" | string | The end time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "23:59:59" |
| "y" | integer | Mask value for days of the week (optional) |
| "a" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to allow specific dates (optional) |
| "x" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to exclude specific dates (optional) |


#### Day of month 

This is used for things like "The 1st of the month," "The 15th of the month," or "the last day of the month."


```cpp
// PROTOTYPE (class LocalTimeSchedule)
LocalTimeSchedule &withDayOfMonth(int dayOfMonth, LocalTimeRange timeRange = LocalTimeRange());
```

- The dayOfMonth specifies which instance (1 = 1st of the month, 2 = 2nd of the month, ... Or -1 = last day, -2 = second to last day, ...)
- A `LocalTimeRange` can handle exception dates, both only on date, or to exclude dates.
- The start of the time range specifies the hour, minute, and second (local time)

For example, the 6th of the month at midnight:

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfMonth(6);
```

The 6th of the month at 6:00 AM local time:

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfMonth(6, LocalTimeHMS("06:00")); 
```

The last day of the month at 11:59:59 PM:

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfMonth(-1, LocalTimeHMS("23:59:59")); 
```

The second to last day of the month:

```cpp
schedule.withDayOfMonth(-2);
```

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "dw" | integer | Day of month instance (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, ... or -1 = last day of month, -2 = second to last, ...| |
| "f" | integer | Flag bits (optional) | 0 |
| "s" | string | The start time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "00:00:00" |
| "e" | string | The end time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS) | "23:59:59" |
| "y" | integer | Mask value for days of the week (optional) |
| "a" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to allow specific dates (optional) |
| "x" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to exclude specific dates (optional) |

#### Time schedule

It's also possible to schedule at a specific time in local time. You can specify zero or more `LocalTimeHMSRestricted` objects, limited by available RAM.

The `LocalTimeHMSRestricted` is itself composed of a `LocalTimeHMS` object, for hours minutes and seconds, and a `LocalTimeRestrictedDate` which can optionally restrict which dates the times re used.

Some ways you can use times:

- "At 17:00:00" every day (local time)
- "At 17:00:00, Monday - Friday"
- "At 09:00:00, Monday - Friday, except for 2022-03-21"
- "At 23:59:59 on 2022-03-31"

```cpp
// PROTOTYPE (class LocalTimeSchedule)
LocalTimeSchedule &withTime(LocalTimeHMSRestricted hms);
LocalTimeSchedule &withTimes(std::initializer_list<LocalTimeHMSRestricted> timesParam);
```

At 4:00 AM local time, every day:

```cpp
schedule.withTime(LocalTimeHMS("04:00"));
```

At 06:00 and 18:30 (4:30 PM) local time, every day. Note the {} surrounding a list of times.

```cpp
schedule.withTimes({LocalTimeHMS("06:00"), LocalTimeHMS("18:30")});
```

At 4:00 AM on weekdays:

```cpp
schedule.withTime(LocalTimeHMSRestricted("04:00", LocalTimeRestrictedDate(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::MASK_WEEKDAY))); 
```

At midnight (local time) on Saturdays:

```cpp
schedule.withTime(LocalTimeHMSRestricted("00:00", LocalTimeRestrictedDate(LocalTimeDayOfWeek::MASK_SATURDAY))); 
```


If configuring by JSON:

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "tm" | string | Time in "HH:MM:SS" format, 24 hour clock, local time |
| "f" | integer | Flag bits (optional) | 0 |
| "y" | number | Mask value for days of the week (optional) |
| "a" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to allow specific dates (optional) |
| "x" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to exclude specific dates (optional) |

#### All methods

<details>

A complete time schedule.

A time schedule consists of minute multiples ("every 15 minutes"), optionally within a time range (all day, or from 09:00:00 to 17:00:00 local time, for example.

It can also have hour multiples, optionally in a time range, at a defined minute ("every 4 hours at :15 
past the hour").

Schedules can be at a specifc day week, with an ordinal (first Monday, last Friday) at a specific time, optionally with exceptions.

Schedules can be a specific day of the month (the 1st, the 5th of the month, the last day of the month, the second to last day of month).

It can also have any number of specific times in the day ("at 08:17:30 local time, 18:15:20 local time") every day, specific days of the week, on specific dates, or with date exceptions.

---

#### LocalTimeSchedule & LocalTimeSchedule::withMinuteOfHour(int increment, LocalTimeRange timeRange) 

Adds a minute multiple schedule in a time range.

```
LocalTimeSchedule & withMinuteOfHour(int increment, LocalTimeRange timeRange)
```

##### Parameters
* `increment` Number of minutes (must be 1 <= minutes <= 59). A value that is is divisible by is recommended. 

* `timeRange` When to apply this minute multiple and/or minute offset (optional)

This schedule publishes every n minutes within the hour. This really is every hour, not rolling, so you should use a value that 60 is divisible by (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30) otherwise there will be an inconsistent period at the top of the hour.

If you specify a time range that does not start at 00:00:00 you can customize which minute the schedule starts at. For example: `15, LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS("00:05:00"), LocalTimeHMS("23:59:59")` will schedule every 15 minutes, but starting at 5 minutes past the hour, so 05:00, 20:00, 35:00, 50:00.

The largest value for hmsEnd of the time range is 23:59:59.

##### Returns
LocalTimeSchedule&

---

#### LocalTimeSchedule & LocalTimeSchedule::withHourOfDay(int hourMultiple, LocalTimeRange timeRange) 

Adds multiple times periodically in a time range with an hour increment.

```
LocalTimeSchedule & withHourOfDay(int hourMultiple, LocalTimeRange timeRange)
```

##### Parameters
* `hourMultiple` Hours between items must be >= 1. For example: 2 = every other hour. 

* `timeRange` Time range to add items to. This is optional; if not specified then the entire day. Also is used to specify a minute offset.

##### Returns
LocalTimeSchedule&

Hours are per day, local time. For whole-day schedules, you will typically use a value that 24 is evenly divisible by (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12), because otherwise the time periods will brief unequal at midnight.

Also note that times are local, and take into account daylight saving. Thus during a time switch, the interval may end up being a different number of hours than specified. For example, if the times would have been 00:00 and 04:00, a hourMultiple of 4, and you do this over a spring forward, the actual number hours between 00:00 and 04:00 is 5 (at least in the US where DST starts at 2:00).

Array of LocalTimeScheduleItem objects:

* mh (integer): Minute of hour (takes place of setting m and i separately)

* hd (integer): Hour of day (takes place of setting m and i separately)

* dw (integer): Day of week (takes place of setting m and i separately)

* dm (integer): Day of month (takes place of setting m and i separately)

* tm (string) Time string in HH:MM:SS format (can omit MM and SS parts, see LocalTimeHMS) for TIME items

* m (integer) type of multiple (optional if mm, )

#### bool LocalTimeSchedule::getNextScheduledTime(LocalTimeConvert & conv) const 

Update the conv object to point at the next schedule item.

```
bool getNextScheduledTime(LocalTimeConvert & conv) const
```

##### Parameters
* `conv` LocalTimeConvert object, may be modified 

##### Returns
true if there is an item available or false if not. if false, conv will be unchanged.

This method finds closest scheduled time for this objecvt, if it's in the near future. The LocalTime::instance().getScheduleLookaheadDays() setting determines how far in the future to check; the default is 3 days. The way schedules work each day needs to be checked to make sure all of the constraints are met, so long look-aheads are computationally intensive. This is not normally an issue, because the idea is that you'll wake from sleep or check the schedule at least every few days, at which point the new schedule may be available.

---

#### bool LocalTimeSchedule::getNextScheduledTime(LocalTimeConvert & conv, std::function< bool(LocalTimeScheduleItem &item)> filter) const 

Update the conv object to point at the next schedule item.

```
bool getNextScheduledTime(LocalTimeConvert & conv, std::function< bool(LocalTimeScheduleItem &item)> filter) const
```

##### Parameters
* `conv` LocalTimeConvert object, may be modified 

* `filter` A function to determine, for each schedule item, if it should be tested 

##### Returns
true if there is an item available or false if not. if false, conv will be unchanged.

This method finds closest scheduled time for this objecvt, if it's in the near future. The LocalTime::instance().getScheduleLookaheadDays() setting determines how far in the future to check; the default is 3 days. The way schedules work each day needs to be checked to make sure all of the constraints are met, so long look-aheads are computationally intensive. This is not normally an issue, because the idea is that you'll wake from sleep or check the schedule at least every few days, at which point the new schedule may be available.

The filter function or lambda has this prototype:

bool filterCallback(LocalTimeScheduleItem &item)

If should return true to check this item, or false to skip this item for schedule checking.

### LocalTimeHMS

This object holds a hour, minute, and second value (HMS). There are numerous methods to compare time values, and convert the values to other formats.

When converting from string format always use 24-hour clock format; this object does not support AM/PM. Also when converting from strings you can omit the seconds, or even both the minutes and seconds.

Note that hour 24 is never a valid value. Because HMS calculations are always inclusive, the end of the day is 23:59:59. Leap seconds are not supported by the underlying C standard time library.

<details>

####  LocalTimeHMS::LocalTimeHMS() 

Default constructor. Sets time to 00:00:00.

```
 LocalTimeHMS()
```

---

####  LocalTimeHMS::~LocalTimeHMS() 

Destructor.

```
virtual  ~LocalTimeHMS()
```

---

####  LocalTimeHMS::LocalTimeHMS(const char * str) 

Constructs the object from a time string.

```
 LocalTimeHMS(const char * str)
```

##### Parameters
* `str` The time string

The time string is normally of the form HH:MM:SS, such as "04:00:00" for 4:00 AM. The hour is in 24-hour format. Other formats are supported as well, including omitting the seconds (04:00), or including only the hour "04", or omitting the leadings zeros (4:0:0).

Additionally, the hour could be negative, used in UTC DST offsets. The minute and second are always positive (0-59). The hour could also be > 24 when used as a timezone offset.

---

####  LocalTimeHMS::LocalTimeHMS(const LocalTimeValue & value) 

Construct this HMS from a LocalTimeValue (which contains YMD and HMS)

```
 LocalTimeHMS(const LocalTimeValue & value)
```

##### Parameters
* `value`

---

#### void LocalTimeHMS::clear() 

Sets the hour, minute, and second to 0.

```
void clear()
```

---

#### void LocalTimeHMS::parse(const char * str) 

Parse a "H:MM:SS" string.

```
void parse(const char * str)
```

##### Parameters
* `str` Input string

Multiple formats are supported, and parts are optional:

* H:MM:SS (examples: "2:00:00" or "2:0:0")

* H:MM (examples: "2:00" or "2:0")

* H (examples: "2")

Hours are always 0 - 23 (24-hour clock). Can also be a negative hour -1 to -23.

---

#### String LocalTimeHMS::toString() const 

Turns the parsed data into a normalized string of the form: "HH:MM:SS" (24-hour clock, with leading zeroes)

```

##### Parameters
* `pTimeInfo` The struct tm to modify

After calling this, the values in the struct tm may be out of range, for example tm_hour > 23. This is fine, as calling mktime/gmtime normalizes this case and carries out-of-range values into the other fields as necessary.

### LocalTimeYMD

This object specifies a year, month, and day. There are numerous methods to compare time values, and convert the values to other formats.

When converting from a string this must always be "YYYY-MM-DD" format, with dashes, and in that order. Other date formats including common but poorly defined United States date formats cannot be used!

<details>


Class for holding a year month day efficiently (4 bytes of storage)

There is no method to get this object from a time_t because time_t is at UTC and this object is intended to be the YMD at local time to correspond with a LocalTimeHMS. Thus it requires a LocalTimeConvert object, and there is a method to get a LocalTimeYMD from a LocalTimeConvert, not from this object.

####  LocalTimeYMD::LocalTimeYMD() 

Default contructor with an invalid date (0000-00-00) set.

```
 LocalTimeYMD()
```

### LocalTimeRange

A `LocalTimeRange` is a start time and end time in local time, expressed as `LocalTimeHMS` objects (hours, minutes, seconds). 

Time ranges are inclusive, so the entire day is 00:00:00 to 23:59:59. 

The default constructor for `LocalTimeRange` sets the time range to the entire day. 

When converting from JSON:

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "s" | string | Starting time in "HH:MM:SS" format, 24 hour clock, local time | "00:00:00" |
| "e" | string | Ending time in "HH:MM:SS" format, 24 hour clock, local time | "23:59:59" |

<details>

####  LocalTimeRange::LocalTimeRange() 

Construct a new Time Range object with the range of the entire day (inclusive)

```
 LocalTimeRange()
```

This is start = 00:00:00, end = 23:59:59. The system clock does not have a concept of leap seconds.

---

####  LocalTimeRange::LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS hmsStart, LocalTimeHMS hmsEnd) 

Construct a new Time Range object with the specifies start and end times.

```
 LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS hmsStart, LocalTimeHMS hmsEnd)
```

##### Parameters
* `hmsStart` Start time in local time 00:00:00 <= hmsStart <= 23:59:59 

* `hmsEnd` End time in local time 00:00:00 <= hmsStart <= 23:59:59 (optional)

Note that 24:00:00 is not a valid time. You should generally use inclusive times such that 23:59:59 is the end of the day.

---

####  LocalTimeRange::LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS hmsStart, LocalTimeHMS hmsEnd, LocalTimeRestrictedDate dateRestriction) 

Construct a new object that specifies start time, end time, and date restrictions.

```
 LocalTimeRange(LocalTimeHMS hmsStart, LocalTimeHMS hmsEnd, LocalTimeRestrictedDate dateRestriction)
```

##### Parameters
* `hmsStart` Start time in local time 00:00:00 <= hmsStart <= 23:59:59 

* `hmsEnd` End time in local time 00:00:00 <= hmsStart <= 23:59:59 

* `dateRestriction` Only use this time range on certain dates

---

#### void LocalTimeRange::clear() 

Clear time range to all day, every day.

```
void clear()
```

---

#### time_t LocalTimeRange::getTimeSpan(const LocalTimeConvert & conv) const 

Get the number of seconds between start and end based on a LocalTimeConvert object.

```
time_t getTimeSpan(const LocalTimeConvert & conv) const
```

The reason for the conv object is that it contains the time to calculate at, as well as the daylight saving time settings. This methods takes into account the actual number of seconds including when a time change is crossed.

##### Parameters
* `conv` The time and timezone settings to calculate the time span at 

##### Returns
time_t Time difference in seconds

In the weird case that start > end, it can return a negative value, as time_t is a signed long (or long long) value.

This does not take into account date restrictions!

---

#### int LocalTimeRange::compareTo(LocalTimeHMS hms) const 

Compares a time (LocalTimeHHS, local time) to this time range.

```
int compareTo(LocalTimeHMS hms) const
```

##### Parameters
* `hms` 

##### Returns
int -1 if hms is before hmsStart, 0 if in range, +1 if hms is after hmsEnd

---

#### bool LocalTimeRange::isValidDate(LocalTimeYMD ymd) const 

Returns true if the date restrictions allow this day.

```
bool isValidDate(LocalTimeYMD ymd) const
```

##### Parameters
* `ymd` 

##### Returns
true 

##### Returns
false

---

#### bool LocalTimeRange::inRange(LocalTimeValue localTimeValue) const 

Returns true if the date restrictions allow this date and the time is in this range (inclusive)

bool inRange(LocalTimeValue localTimeValue) const
```

##### Parameters
* `localTimeValue` 

##### Returns
true 

##### Returns
false

---

#### void LocalTimeRange::fromTime(LocalTimeHMSRestricted hms)

---

#### void LocalTimeRange::fromJson(JSONValue jsonObj) 

Fills in the time range from a JSON object.

```
void fromJson(JSONValue jsonObj)
```

##### Parameters
* `jsonObj` 

Keys:

* s (string) The start time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS)

* e (string) The end time (HH:MM:SS format, can omit MM or SS)

</details>

##### LocalTimeDayOfWeek

A `LocalTimeDayOfWeek` specifies zero or more days of the week (Sunday, Monday, ...)

Common mask values:

| Value Hex | Value Decimal | Constant | Description |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 0x01 | 1 | MASK_SUNDAY | Sunday |
| 0x02 | 2 | MASK_MONDAY | Monday |
| 0x04 | 4 | MASK_TUESDAY | Tuesday |
| 0x08 | 8 | MASK_WEDNESDAY | Wednesday |
| 0x10 | 16 | MASK_THURSDAY | Thursday |
| 0x20 | 32 | MASK_FRIDAY | Friday |
| 0x40 | 64 | MASK_SATURDAY | Saturday | 
| 0x7f | 127 | MASK_ALL | Every day |
| 0x3e | 62 | MASK_WEEKDAY | Weekdays (Monday - Friday) | 
| 0x41 | 65 | MASK_WEEKEND | Weekends (Saturday - Sunday) |

Note that you can combine any mask bits. For example, Monday, Wednesday, Friday is 2 + 8 + 32 = 42,

In JSON, you can only use the numeric mask values, as a decimal number. For example, weekdays Monday - Friday is 62.

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "y" | number | Mask value for days of the week, see table above |

#### LocalTimeRestrictedDate

A `LocalTimeRestrictedDate` is used for both multiples and times (below). It can have:

- A day of week selection (`LocalTimeDayOfWeek`), which is a bitmask of days to allow. This makes it easy to specify, for example, weekdays (Monday - Friday).
- A list of dates to allow (vector of `LocalTimeYMD`)
- A list of dates to exclude (vector of `LocalTimeYMD`)

| Key | Type | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "y" | number | Mask value for days of the week, see table above (optional) |
| "a" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to allow specific dates (optional) |
| "x" | Array of string | Array of strings of the form YYYY-MM-DD to exclude specific dates (optional) |

<details>

# class LocalTimeSchedule 

A complete time schedule.

A time schedule consists of minute multiples ("every 15 minutes"), optionally within a time range (all day, or from 09:00:00 to 17:00:00 local time, for example.

It can also have hour multiples, optionally in a time range, at a defined minute ("every 4 hours at :15 
past the hour").

Schedules can be at a specifc day week, with an ordinal (first Monday, last Friday) at a specific time, optionally with exceptions.

Schedules can be a specific day of the month (the 1st, the 5th of the month, the last day of the month, the second to last day of month).

It can also have any number of specific times in the day ("at 08:17:30 local time, 18:15:20 local time") every day, specific days of the week, on specific dates, or with date exceptions.
